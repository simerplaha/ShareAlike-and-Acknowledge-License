# ShareAlike and Acknowledge License

[ShareAlike and Acknowledge License](/LICENSE.md) encourages sharing similar/alike work and attribution for contributors.

## Scope
Covers both, software/libraries that allow dynamic linking and software that run remotely on a network.

## Allows 
- Do whatever! Copy, replicate, modify, improve or sell.
- Use any License you like (permission, copyleft or unlicensed) on derivatives.

## Asks
- For a copy of __JUST__ the improvements that are similar/alike to the project 
itself so that it helps the project contributors with their work by avoiding duplicate 
efforts and improves their knowledge on the project's subject.
- Optionally give attribution to the contributors if requested by the author. 

## Why?
Current open-source Licenses are great! But they can be either too restrictive (strong copyleft) and limit software 
usage by being viral and infectious or they are too relaxed (weak copyleft or permissive) 
that they allow room for hoarding knowledge that prevents further creative work.

This license asks for sharing similar/alike work and optionally attribution for contributors.

## NOT_ALIKE file
It's hard to generalise "alike" work for all project. The license mentions that exposing a software over a network 
is considered alike work, but that might not be the case for everyone so you can override and extend this by 
mentioning a list of **not alike** work by creating a `NOT_ALIKE` prefixed file in your project. 
See [NOT_ALIKE_DEMO.md](/NOT_ALIKE_DEMO.md). 

License quotes
> See accompanied file prefixed NOT_ALIKE for a list of exempted work that are declared as not Alike Work and are __NOT__ bound
  to Terms and Conditions of this License.

This concept was borrowed from GPL and how it allows license [exceptions](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gcc-exception-3.1.html).

If the `NOT_ALIKE` prefixed file is not supplied then, by default, the license considers all derivative/adapted work to be alike. 

## References 

To create this license I referred and read as many other licenses I could with the goal 
to follow the same pattern, formatting and expressing the terms and conditions in similar fashion. 
And also to __NOT__ to create something new that might not be legally acceptable.
